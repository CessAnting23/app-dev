## **Code for Fun**
Here's a snippet inspired by the show's Dungeons & Dragons theme:


const rollDice = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 1;

const attack = rollDice();
if (attack >= 15) {
  console.log("Critical hit! The Demogorgon is defeated!");
} else {
  console.log("You missed! Run before it strikes back!");
}
